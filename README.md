# Minecraft-Stream-Simulation
Vertical falling pickaxe simulation for YouTube interactive livestream.

To use, put your livestream url in the config.json file and set listen_to_stream to true, then run main.py from the src directory.

IMPORTANT: For clean rendering, screen width and height should always be multiples of the block texture resolution times the camera size (Eg. 624x1248 with camera_size=13).
If this does not happen, block textures may appear choppy or distorted.

You can also change many parameters, such as block attributes, biome data, and tnt settings, inside the json files.
